## Hi there 👋
I'm Vivian, a developer and platform engineer from New England. I really enjoy learning stuff. 

I work on a lot of different projects in many different disciplines. Some favorite and longest-running projects are [my homelab](https://github.com/viv-codes/homelab), [filesort](https://github.com/viv-codes/filesort), the [CSH homepage redesign](https://github.com/viv-codes/CSHPublicSite), [CSH's airgap lab](https://github.com/ComputerScienceHouse/airgap), and [my personal site](https://github.com/viv-codes/personal-site). 

This summer, I'm excited to be on co-op with the Defense Finance Accounting Service in an application development role.
